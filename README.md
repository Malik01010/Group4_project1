# Pizza Shop Orders Database

Our task was to build a Relational Database focused on the day to day operations surrounding a Pizza Shop. Managing a pizza shop requires keeping track of orders in a way that helps the business run smoothly. Knowing which pizzas are most popular and having accurate data is essential. If managers don't track orders effectively, they could run into problems like wasting food, being understaffed during busy times, or delivering orders late. By using an efficient SQL system, managers can stay on top of trends, optimize staffing, and improve customer satisfaction, all of which are key to the shop's success.
